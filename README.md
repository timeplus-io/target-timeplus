`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Target Authentication and Authorization

You need to create a free account at https://timeplus.com. Sign up with a Google or Microsoft ID, then create a new workspace with a random ID and a friendly name. Then you will be redirected to https://us.timeplus.cloud/wsId1234/console 

You need to create an API key to access Timeplus REST API. To do so:

1. Click the user icon on the top-right corner.
2. Choose Personal Settings
3. Choose the 2nd tab API Key Management
4. Click the Create API Key button
5. Set a readable name and choose an expiration date
6. Save the API key securely in your computer. You are not going to retrieve the plain text key again in the console.

```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `target_timeplus/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-timeplus` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-timeplus --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-timeplus
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-timeplus --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the "tap-smoke-test" sample:
meltano elt tap-smoke-test target-timeplus
```
